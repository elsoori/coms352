COMS 352: INTRODUCTION TO OPERATING SYSTEMS

Project 1 A: Creating a system call in xv6. The new system call, count, will return the total number of processes currently on the system.

Project 1 B: Prepare system calls and utilities that will be used to implement and evaluate a new scheduler.

Project 1 C: Implement two schedulers: a queue-based round-robin scheduler and a stride scheduler that achieves fair-share (aka proportional-share) scheduling. Both schedulers use a queue data structure.
